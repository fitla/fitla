    <h1>About Fitla</h1>

    <p>Hello! I'm the heart behind Fitla â€” a lifelong crochet enthusiast whoâ€™s been turning yarn into joy since I was a little girl. What started as a quiet passion has blossomed into a small business built on creativity, patience, and love. ðŸ’–</p>

    <p>Every bag I create is a piece of my story â€” handcrafted to bring beauty and individuality into your daily life. My goal is to share this craft with others, spreading warmth and personality through each custom design. From my hands to yours, thank you for supporting this dream.</p>
